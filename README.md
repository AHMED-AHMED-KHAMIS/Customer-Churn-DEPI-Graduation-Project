## Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the DEPI graduation requirement. It focuses on the churn problem faced by telecom companies and involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to predict the likelihood of customer churn.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior to identify churn drivers.
- Preprocess data for modeling.
- Build and evaluate a predictive model for churn classification.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce customer churn.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLAlchemy
- **SQL**: Data extraction and transformation
- **SSIS**: Data warehousing
- **Microsoft Azure**: Cloud services
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and reporting
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For development and analysis
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project includes customer demographics, service usage, and billing information.

## Data Processing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming categorical variables, creating new features.
- **Normalization**: Standardizing data for model input.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to understand customer patterns, identify significant features, and visualize churn-related trends.

## Modeling
Several models were trained and evaluated, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine

## Evaluation
Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model with the best performance was selected for deployment.
